## Prerequisites

To use this example, you need to have the following:

- A developer account with Apple and access to App Store Connect
- A set of API keys to access App Store Connect API
- Deno installed on your machine

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repositoryï¼Œgo to the `deno_example` directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/appstore-connect-sdk.git

cd appstore-connect-sdk/deno_example
